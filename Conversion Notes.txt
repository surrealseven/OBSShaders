To convert StreamFX to ShaderFilter:

change "id" from "streamfx-filter-shader" to "shader_filter"
change "versioned_id" from "streamfx-filter-shader" to "shader_filter"
under settings, remove "Commit", "Version", and "Shader.Shader.Technique"
under settings, change "Shder.Shader.File" to "shader_file_name"
under settings, add "from_file": true
under settings, change the value of "shader_file_name" to point to the new equivalent shader

Remember the new shaders have the extension .shader, not .effect.
The new shaders are also all in the same directory instead of being split up between Filter, Source, and Transition.  Each new shader has a Filter_, Source_, or Transition_ prefix.
Array indexers must be replaced with underscores in the shader values.  I.e.  "OffsetU[0]" becomes "OffsetU_0"
Unfortunately colors are stored as an integer instead of as an array of floats.  You'll either need to know the numeric value of a color or re-choose it in the OBS UI.
